This code is used to automate boring bitch work which will take minutes/hours manually. But with our love python, it can be achieved in seconds/minutes.

## How To Use:
- Code for what you need (itna to karna pdega na)

## Possible Future Work
- Making a GUI to make it user friendly (non coders friendly)
- Vision is to achieve something that aleady exists (autohotkey)
- Then why am I making this? Maybe for fun and to learn (maybe)

But I am too lazy to do this.
